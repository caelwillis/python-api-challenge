# python-api-challenge

For this challenge, we are analyzing weather data from a random selection of countries from across the globe, and using that data to look for vacation housing accomodations. We must first pull city data from Geoapify and our Weather API source. 

We will then graph a linear regression of data for each of these cities to see if a country's coordinates have an impact on the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness.

After our first analysis, we want to narrow our list of countries down to just a select few that have idea weather conditions for our vacation. Finally we want to identify the closest hotel within a radius of 10,000 meters from the center of the city. With this information we can come to a conclusion of what cities present us with the best options for our future vacation.
